Hi there.

welcome to OBCSS project.
*****What is it*****
OBCSS is a very small project that i made to make my life easy
it`s a php "kind of framework" to make css files.

*****How to use it*****
to use it download the files and in the css folder you will find
obcss.css that`s the file that you want to modify.

in the config.php & User.json you will find the "shortcuts" that you can use
inside the obcss.css file (right now there are very small)

to make the magic happens just load the index.html it will trigger the script



Good day,
Barak
